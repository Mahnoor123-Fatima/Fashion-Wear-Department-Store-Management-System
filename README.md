# Fashion-Wear-Department-Store-Management-System
This is a Console based Application which allows the users to make a purchase from the list of the products currently available in the departmental store. It also manages the record of the products and the purchase history. It also calculate bills of customer and keep record of them. In this i use concept of OOP and File Handling.
This project intends to introduce more user friendliness in the various activities such as record updation, maintenance, and searching. The searching of record has been made quite simple as all the details of the customer can be obtained by simply keying in the identification or account number of that customer. Similarly, record maintenance and updation can also be accomplished by using the account number with all the details being automatically generated. These details are also being promptly automatically updated in the master file thus keeping the record absolutely up-to-date. 
  
# Statement of the problem 
Sometimes it becomes difficult to calculate the number of goods and products in department store and to record huge amount of data on papers. We can not count a single product by pointing a finger over it. It is a quite hectic task to do. In order to reduce this effort I have done that task. To make data of both customer and seller private and secure I develop this application.
